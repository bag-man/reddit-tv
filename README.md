# Reddit.tv in one HTML file
I decided to make my own version of reddit.tv since it got taken down. Turns out there a lot of existing replacements such as rake.tv, however it was fun to make this project. I did it all client side in the simplest manner possible which is kinda neat. 

## ToDo
* Handle getting more videos once queue is empty
* Embed comments possibly
